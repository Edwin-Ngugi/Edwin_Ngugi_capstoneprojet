      <h3>Autobiography of Edwin Ngugi Muruja</h3>

      <h4>Chapter 1: Birth Into Uncertainty</h4>
      <p>I was born on November 21, 2003, in Kayole, Nairobi, a densely populated area marked by both resilience and hardship. My birth came with a unique distinction—I arrived as a twin, alongside my brother, Tony Mutuma. While twins are often viewed as a blessing, our arrival also brought overwhelming responsibility to our mother, who was facing serious economic and emotional challenges at the time. Raising two infants in an unforgiving environment demanded strength beyond measure. Our mother endured sleepless nights, food insecurity, and uncertainty about the future. Despite these hardships, she remained determined to protect us. Her struggle formed the foundation of my understanding of sacrifice, love, and perseverance. From the very beginning, my life was shaped by resilience.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 2: A Mother’s Silent Struggle</h4>
      <p>Our mother’s early years with us were marked by relentless sacrifice. With limited resources, she fought tirelessly to provide basic needs. She often went without so that we could survive. Her strength was quiet, uncelebrated, yet powerful. Eventually, the weight of responsibility became too heavy to bear alone. This moment did not reflect failure, but rather wisdom—the courage to seek help. Her struggle taught me that strength also lies in knowing when to accept support. With her guidance, even in absentia later, I learnt the values of love, compassion, and the significance of believing in oneself throughout my journey.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 3: Family Intervention and Rescue</h4>
      <p>Recognizing the difficulty of our situation, our extended family stepped in. Our grandparents, together with our uncle, made the life-altering decision to take us in. This intervention changed the course of our lives. We were moved from the crowded streets of Nairobi to the peaceful highlands of Tharaka Nithi County, Maara Constituency. This transition marked the beginning of stability, structure, and hope.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 4: The Sacrifice of Our Uncle</h4>
      <p>Our uncle became a central pillar in our lives. After completing high school, he attended college while carrying the responsibility of raising us. Through discipline, faith, and perseverance, he later secured employment at the Kenya Power Lighting Company by God’s grace. Despite later being privileged to start his own family, he never withdrew his support from us. His life taught me that success does not mean abandoning responsibility.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 5: Grandparents as Our Foundation</h4>
      <p>Our grandparents provided a nurturing environment rooted in discipline, faith, and love. Despite health challenges—our grandmother suffering from hypertension and our grandfather living with asthma—they remained actively supportive. I remember evenings when my grandfather would tell us stories by the fire, his voice raspy but full of wisdom. My grandmother, despite her condition, insisted on teaching us patience and gratitude. Their resilience in the face of illness taught me empathy and the importance of cherishing family bonds. The strong faith foundation in my home was an important foundation in my upbringing.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 6: Early Childhood in Tharaka Nithi</h4>
      <p>Growing up in Tharaka Nithi shaped my character profoundly. Life was simple yet purposeful. Daily chores, farming activities, and community interactions taught responsibility and humility. The rural environment offered peace and moral grounding. I learned that happiness does not come from abundance but from gratitude. The hills and valleys became my playground, and the community became my extended family.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 7: Educational Beginnings at Ngeru Primary</h4>
      <p>My formal education began at Ngeru Primary School. From nursery to Standard Four, I acquired foundational academic skills and discipline. Teachers instilled in us the belief that education was the key to a better future. Here, I interacted with students from different places and learned the importance of socializing with people. These priceless experiences produced friendships that would see me through numerous milestones, forming a network of support on which I could always rely.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 8: Developing Academic Curiosity</h4>
      <p>As I advanced, curiosity became my strength. I enjoyed problem-solving and actively participating in class. This stage taught me that learning extends beyond textbooks. The teachers’ mentorship and support were instrumental in shaping my academic trajectory and instilling in me a love for learning. Being a dedicated student, I could easily grasp things in class, and my dedication began to pay off.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 9: Transition to Rubate Achievers Academy</h4>
      <p>Joining Rubate Achievers Academy marked academic advancement. The structured environment challenged me to raise my standards. Family sacrifices reinforced my appreciation for education. I realized that my parents and guardians wanted the best for me, so I flourished in my studies and loved studying.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 10: Academic Growth and Discipline</h4>
      <p>At Rubate, I developed discipline, consistency, and confidence. Competition pushed me to believe in my abilities. These lessons prepared me for boarding school life. I slowly got used to the new environment and enrolled in different activities. I learned to be more selective in the activities I participated in, focusing on those that aligned with my interests and goals.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 11: Boarding Life at St. Anselm Mururi</h4>
      <p>In 2016, I joined St. Anselm Mururi Boarding School. Living away from family demanded independence and resilience. Getting used to the regularity of boarding school life had its own set of difficulties and advantages. The organized schedule and common living spaces were hard to adjust to, but regular connection with classmates had an unavoidable transforming influence on my personal growth. Lifelong connections were formed, and memories were imprinted into the fabric of my being.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 12: Preparing for KCPE</h4>
      <p>KCPE preparation was intense. Long study hours and strict routines defined this period. The experience taught me perseverance under pressure. I sought help from teachers and classmates when I needed clarification, rather than struggling on my own. These strategies helped me become more efficient and productive, enabling me to excel in my academics.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 13: Joining Nkubu High School</h4>
      <p>High school at Nkubu introduced new academic and social challenges. Adaptability became essential. I learned responsibility and self-control. It was here that I faced the challenge of overcoming self-doubt and fear of failure. As I took on more demanding courses, I often questioned my abilities, but I realized these fears were holding me back from reaching my full potential. To overcome this, I embraced a growth mindset, reminding myself that failure is a natural part of the learning process.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 14: Character Formation in High School</h4>
      <p>High school shaped my integrity and resilience. Failures taught humility, while success reinforced persistence. Education became both academic and moral. Beyond the classroom, I engaged with people from other backgrounds, sharing tales and fun, forming connections that extended far beyond the school grounds. These contacts enlarged my horizons, establishing in me a strong appreciation for diversity.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 15: The Pandemic Interlude</h4>
      <p>Before sitting for my final exams, the world changed dramatically. The year 2020 dawned, bringing with it an unparalleled global epidemic. Learning institutions suspended operations, and I found myself back home. With the extra free time provided by the pandemic, I engaged in farming activities. Though not something I initially prioritized, farming helped me not only improve my physical health but also provided mental peace during the trying times. It became clear that our lives may change in an instant, reminding us of the significance of savoring the time we have with loved ones.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 16: KCSE and Transition to University</h4>
      <p>Sitting for KCSE in 2021 carried emotional weight. Passing symbolized collective family sacrifice. It marked a major milestone in my journey. Admission to Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT) was transformative. University demanded self-discipline and accountability. Campus life embraced me with open arms, providing a dynamic and energetic environment that encouraged personal development. I was overwhelmed by a distinct sense of energy and opportunity the instant I stepped upon the lovely grounds of Dedan Kimathi.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 17: Discovering Technology as Purpose</h4>
      <p>Technology became my passion. I explored programming, systems, and applied computing. I realized its potential to solve real-world problems, especially in agriculture. I chose this path because I was captivated by the ever-evolving nature of the world. I wanted to be a part of this dynamic environment and have the ability to contribute to problem-solving activities. The course has so far made me understand different world phenomena, and I look forward to using it to solve problems in the outside world.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 18: Campus Life and Practical Experiences</h4>
      <p>Lectures, tutorials, and practical sessions laid the intellectual groundwork for my selected subject of study. Recognizing the importance of practical experience, I actively sought out opportunities to apply the knowledge and skills I acquired in the classroom to real-world scenarios. This experiential learning aspect was highly appealing to me as it helped me develop crucial skills. Additionally, the supportive community of fellow students became my second family. Study groups and late-night discussions became a regular part of my routine as we navigated through assignments together.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 19: Family Support and Vision</h4>
      <p>Despite challenges, my family remained my anchor. My uncle balanced work at Kenya Power and family while supporting us. My grandparents continued encouraging me despite health limitations. My vision is to leverage technology for community empowerment. I aspire to build scalable solutions that improve livelihoods. Innovation, integrity, and impact guide my goals. As I approach the end of my studies, I am focused on completing my coursework and conducting research for my projects.</p>

      <h4>Chapter 20: Reflection and Conclusion</h4>
      <p>My journey—from Kayole to Tharaka Nithi, from struggle to purpose—is a testament to faith, sacrifice, and resilience. I stand on the sacrifices of my mother, uncle, and grandparents. Joining Dedan Kimathi University has been a transformative experience that expanded my knowledge and shaped my character. My story proves that background does not define destiny. With support, determination, and gratitude, adversity can be transformed into purpose. I am excited to continue my academic journey and embrace the challenges and triumphs that await me in the coming years.</p>

      <h3>Agricultural Innovation Abstract</h3>
      <p>Agriculture remains the backbone of many African economies, providing livelihoods for a large percentage of the population and contributing significantly to national food security. Despite its importance, small-scale farmers across the continent continue to face persistent challenges, including frequent crop diseases, limited access to qualified agricultural extension officers, high costs of farm inputs, and unreliable or non-existent internet connectivity, especially in rural and remote areas. These challenges often result in delayed decision-making, reduced crop yields, and significant economic losses for farming households.</p>
      <p>This presentation examines an important information technology innovation: offline mobile agricultural applications developed to support farmers in the early diagnosis and management of crop diseases without the need for continuous internet access. The applications utilize machine learning models that are trained on images of crop diseases and deployed directly on mobile devices, allowing farmers to capture images of affected plants and receive instant diagnostic feedback and treatment recommendations.</p>
      <p>By enabling real-time, data-driven decision-making at the farm level, these applications empower farmers with practical knowledge, reduce dependence on scarce agricultural experts, and minimize preventable crop losses. Furthermore, the offline nature of the technology makes it particularly suitable for the African context, where internet infrastructure remains uneven. Overall, this innovation illustrates how information technology can deliver sustainable, affordable, and locally relevant solutions to agricultural challenges in Africa, while contributing to increased productivity, improved livelihoods, and enhanced food security.</p>

      <h3>Teknolojia katika Kilimo</h3>
      <p>Kilimo kinabaki kuwa uti wa mgongo wa chumi nyingi za Afrika, kikitoa njia za kujikimu kwa asilimia kubwa ya watu na kuchangia pakubwa katika usalama wa chakula wa kitaifa. Licha ya umuhimu wake, wakulima wadogo barani kote wanaendelea kukabiliwa na changamoto sugu, zikiwemo milipuko ya mara kwa mara ya magonjwa ya mazao, upatikanaji mdogo wa maafisa ugani waliohitimu, gharama kubwa za pembejeo za kilimo, na ukosefu wa intaneti au mtandao usio wa kutegemewa, hasa maeneo ya vijijini. Changamoto hizi mara nyingi husababisha kuchelewa kufanya maamuzi, kupungua kwa mavuno, na hasara kubwa za kiuchumi kwa kaya zinazotegemea kilimo.</p>
      <p>Wasilisho hili linaangazia ubunifu muhimu wa teknolojia ya habari: programu za kilimo za simu za mkononi zinazofanya kazi bila mtandao (offline), zilizotengenezwa kusaidia wakulima katika utambuzi wa mapema na udhibiti wa magonjwa ya mazao bila kuhitaji intaneti ya kudumu. Programu hizi hutumia mifumo ya kujifunza kwa mashine (machine learning) iliyofunzwa kwa picha za magonjwa ya mazao na kuwekwa moja kwa moja kwenye simu, zikiwaruhusu wakulima kupiga picha mimea iliyoathirika na kupata majibu ya papo hapo kuhusu utambuzi wa ugonjwa na mapendekezo ya tiba.</p>
      <p>Kwa kuwezesha ufanyaji maamuzi wa papo hapo unaoongozwa na data katika ngazi ya shambani, programu hizi huwapa wakulima ujuzi wa vitendo, hupunguza utegemezi kwa wataalamu wa kilimo ambao ni wachache, na kupunguza hasara za mazao zinazoweza kuzuilika. Aidha, uwezo wa teknolojia hii kufanya kazi bila mtandao unaifanya ifae sana kwa mazingira ya Afrika, ambapo miundombinu ya intaneti bado haijatengemaa. Kwa ujumla, ubunifu huu unaonyesha jinsi teknolojia ya habari inavyoweza kutoa suluhisho endelevu, nafuu, na linaloendana na mazingira kwa changamoto za kilimo barani Afrika, huku ikichangia kuongezeka kwa tija, kuboresha maisha, na kuimarisha usalama wa chakula.</p>

      <h3>Aspect of African Culture Abstract</h3>
      <p>Oral storytelling is one of the oldest and most significant forms of cultural heritage in African societies. Long before the introduction of formal education and written records, African communities relied on storytelling to preserve their history, transmit cultural values, educate younger generations, and strengthen social cohesion. Through folktales, myths, legends, and proverbs, societies communicated moral lessons, social norms, and collective identity. Storytelling was often carried out by elders or specialized custodians such as griots, who played a crucial role as historians, educators, and cultural leaders.</p>
      <p>Beyond cultural preservation, oral storytelling has a powerful influence on how gender roles and relationships are understood within society. Traditional narratives often portray men as leaders, warriors, and decision-makers, while women are commonly depicted as caregivers, mothers, and symbols of obedience. While these representations reflect historical social structures, they can also reinforce gender stereotypes and inequality if left unexamined. As a result, it is important to critically analyze storytelling as a cultural tool that shapes attitudes toward gender from an early age.</p>
      <p>This presentation examines the historical background and cultural importance of oral storytelling in Africa, with a specific focus on gender awareness. It highlights how contemporary storytellers are reinterpreting traditional narratives to promote balanced gender roles, equality, and mutual respect. By adapting storytelling to address modern social realities, oral traditions can continue to preserve African culture while contributing to gender equality and social transformation in contemporary society.</p>

      <h3>Muhtasasri wa Nguzo ya Utamaduni wa Afrika</h3>
      <p>Usimulizi wa hadithi kwa njia ya mdomo ni mojawapo ya urithi muhimu zaidi wa kitamaduni katika jamii za Kiafrika. Kabla ya kuwepo kwa elimu rasmi na maandishi, jamii za Afrika zilitumia hadithi kuhifadhi historia yao, kuwasilisha maadili ya jamii, kuelimisha watoto, na kuimarisha mshikamano wa kijamii. Kupitia hadithi za jadi, mithali, hekaya, na visa, jamii ziliweza kufundisha maadili, kanuni za kijamii, na utambulisho wa pamoja. Wazee na wasimulizi maalum kama vile griots walikuwa na jukumu muhimu la kuhifadhi na kusambaza maarifa haya.</p>
      <p>Mbali na kuhifadhi utamaduni, hadithi za mdomo zina mchango mkubwa katika kuunda uelewa wa majukumu ya kijinsia katika jamii. Kwa kawaida, hadithi nyingi za jadi humwonyesha mwanaume kama kiongozi, shujaa, au mtoa maamuzi, huku mwanamke akionyeshwa kama mlezi, mama, au mtu mnyenyekevu. Ingawa taswira hizi zinaakisi hali za kijamii za zamani, zinaweza pia kuendeleza dhana potofu za kijinsia endapo hazitachunguzwa kwa kina.</P>
      <p>Uwasilishaji huu unachunguza historia na umuhimu wa usimulizi wa hadithi za mdomo katika utamaduni wa Afrika, kwa kuzingatia kwa kina suala la uelewa wa kijinsia. Unabainisha jinsi wasimulizi wa kisasa wanavyobadilisha hadithi za jadi ili kuhimiza usawa wa kijinsia, heshima, na ushirikiano. Kwa kufanya hivyo, usimulizi wa hadithi unaendelea kuwa chombo muhimu cha kuhifadhi utamaduni huku ukichangia mabadiliko chanya ya kijamii.</P>

      <h3>Video Presentation Abstract: Challenges in Modern Society</h3>
      <h4>Title: The Paradox of Connection: Strategic Interventions for Youth Mental Health and Community Cohesion in the Digital Age</h4>
      <p>In the contemporary digital landscape, social media platforms have evolved from simple communication tools into dominant forces shaping the psychological development and social behaviors of the youth. While these platforms promise unprecedented connectivity, empirical evidence suggests a correlation between heavy usage and a rising mental health crisis characterized by anxiety, depression, and body dysmorphia. This presentation critically analyzes the "attention economy," where algorithms prioritize sensationalism and "curated perfection" over authentic human connection. Consequently, young people are increasingly trapped in cycles of social comparison and cyberbullying, leading to isolation and the erosion of physical community bonds.</p>
      <p>The core of this presentation challenges the passive acceptance of this digital status quo. It proposes a multifaceted solution centered on Digital Resilience and Community Reintegration. First, it advocates for the implementation of a comprehensive "Digital Citizenship" curriculum in schools that moves beyond basic safety to teach critical analysis of algorithms and the psychology of influence. Second, it proposes a community-led initiative to establish "Green Zones"—dedicated physical spaces and times where digital devices are restricted to foster face-to-face interaction, intergenerational storytelling, and shared physical activities. By treating digital consumption as a public health issue similar to nutrition, this presentation outlines a roadmap for restoring mental well-being and strengthening the social fabric of modern society.</p>

      <h3>Muhtasari wa Wasilisho la Video: Changamoto katika Jamii ya Kisasa</h3>
      <h4>Kichwa: Kitendawili cha Muunganisho: Mikakati ya Kutatua Janga la Afya ya Akili na Mgawanyiko wa Kijamii Miongoni mwa Vijana</h4>
      <p>Katika ulimwengu wa sasa wa kidijitali, mitandao ya kijamii imebadilika kutoka kuwa nyezo rahisi za mawasiliano na kuwa nguvu kuu inayounda makuzi ya kisaikolojia na tabia za kijamii za vijana. Ingawa majukwaa haya yanaahidi muunganisho usio na kifani, ushahidi unaonyesha uhusiano wa moja kwa moja kati ya matumizi ya kupita kiasi na kuongezeka kwa janga la afya ya akili, linalojidhihirisha kupitia wasiwasi, msongo wa mawazo, na kutojiamini. Wasilisho hili linachambua kwa kina "uchumi wa umakini" (attention economy), ambapo mifumo ya kompyuta (algorithms) hupa kipaumbele maudhui ya kusisimua na "ukamilifu wa kuigiza" badala ya uhusiano halisi wa kibinadamu. Matokeo yake, vijana wanazidi kunaswa katika mitego ya kujilinganisha na wengine na unyanyasaji wa mtandaoni, hali inayosababisha upweke na kumomonyoka kwa umoja wa jamii katika ulimwengu halisi.</p>
      <p>Kiini cha wasilisho hili ni kupinga hali hii ya kukubali utumwa wa kidijitali. Linapendekeza suluhisho la pande mbili linalolenga Ustahimilivu wa Kidijitali na Urejesho wa Jamii. Kwanza, linatetea kuanzishwa kwa mtaala wa "Uraia wa Kidijitali" mashuleni ambao unafundisha uchambuzi wa kina wa jinsi mitandao inavyofanya kazi na saikolojia ya ushawishi. Pili, linapendekeza mpango wa kijamii wa kuanzisha "Maeneo ya Kijani"—ambayo ni maeneo maalum yasiyoruhusu vifaa vya kidijitali ili kuhimiza mazungumzo ya ana kwa ana, hadithi za kiasili, na michezo ya pamoja. Kwa kuchukulia matumizi ya kidijitali kama suala la afya ya umma, wasilisho hili linatoa mwongozo wa kurejesha ustawi wa akili na kuimarisha msingi wa jamii ya kisasa.</p>

      <h3>Photographic Essay: Unemployment and the Jua Kali Economy</h3>
      <p><strong>Theme:</strong> Bridging the Unemployment Gap through 'Jua Kali' Innovation.</p>
      <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> In a landscape where formal employment is scarce, the African youth are not waiting for opportunities—they are forging them. This essay documents the grit, the sparks, and the ingenuity of the informal sector, where scrap metal becomes machinery and survival evolves into innovation.</p>

          <img src="images/Various scrap metal objects.jpg" alt="Jua Kali Workshop Scene" class="essay-img">
          <p><strong>One man’s trash is another man’s treasure. In the informal economy, resourcefulness is the primary currency. This 'scrapyard' is actually a warehouse of infinite potential.</p>

          <h4>2. The Spark of Industry</h4>
          <img src="images/Photo_ Karolo Tivizas_ The Blacksmith.jpg" alt="Welding sparks flying" class="essay-img">
          <p><strong>Without advanced factories or automated assembly lines, the industrialization of the community happens one spark at a time, driven by human hands.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="photo-card">

          <img src="images/POV_ Engineering students would rather be in the….jpg" alt="Older mechanic teaching younger apprentice" class="essay-img">
          <p><strong>The Classroom without Walls. Skills in the African community are often passed down through mentorship rather than formal technical colleges. This intergenerational transfer ensures survival.</p>

          <h4>4. Innovation from Necessity</h4>
          <img src="images/masaimarket  kenya  culture.jpg" alt="Recycled material invention" class="essay-img">
          <p><These products solve local problems—energy poverty, food security—at a fraction of the cost of imported goods. This is engineering stripped to its most essential form.</p>

          <h4>5. The Dignity of Labor</h4>

          <p>Employment is not just about income; it is about dignity. In a continent facing a youth unemployment crisis, the Jua Kali sector offers a path to self-reliance and pride.</p>
